# Bigram-File-Analysis

This is a set of notebooks for generating bigram distributions of data (such as files or images) and analyzing them to attempt to determine what kind of files they are. Given an adequate volume of training samples, it is fairly accurate in its analysis and can easily be modified to scan "composite" file structures such as tars, compressed file systems, and disk images.
